Title: Loan Price Prediction: A Machine Learning Model with Web Interface

#Abstract:

The "Loan Price Prediction" project presents a comprehensive approach to building a machine learning model for predicting loan prices. This project leverages a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple machine learning algorithms to develop a robust model. Additionally, a user-friendly web interface is implemented using HTML and Flask, enabling users to interact with the predictive model.



#Data Preparation:

A historical dataset spanning the previous 10 years serves as the foundation for this project. This dataset is divided into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set to facilitate model development and evaluation. Data cleaning and processing techniques are applied to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.



#Machine Learning Algorithms:

The project explores a range of machine learning algorithms, including:



Gradient Boosting Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

These algorithms are employed to train predictive models, which will be compared for their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.



#Python Libraries:

The project leverages Python libraries to facilitate data manipulation and visualization. Key libraries used include Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for data visualization.



#Model Evaluation:

The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using key metrics such as confusion matrices. These metrics are used to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, providing insight into the model's predictive capabilities.



#Results:

The project demonstrates a remarkable prediction accuracy, with an average accuracy exceeding 85%. This indicates the model's ability to provide reliable predictions for loan prices, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions and individuals looking to make informed decisions regarding loans.



The "Loan Price Prediction" project showcases the power of machine learning and the user-friendliness of web interfaces, providing an accessible and effective solution for predicting loan prices based on historical data and sophisticated algorithms.
